## For use the repository need to install the api dummy using there:

  https://github.com/irichardo/Optima-Interview-Api-Dummy

  Then Run `npm i` or `pnpm i` to install, Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and the application will autmatically init.

  Thanks for the oportunity, I have used very little Angular but with motivation I am sure there will be no stopping me.
